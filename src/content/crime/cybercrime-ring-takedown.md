A coordinated law enforcement operation spanning three continents has dismantled what authorities describe as one of the largest ransomware operations in history.

## The Takedown

The FBI, working with Europol and authorities in seven countries, executed simultaneous raids early Tuesday morning. The operation resulted in:

- 12 arrests across the United States, Germany, and Ukraine
- Seizure of $45 million in cryptocurrency
- Shutdown of infrastructure used in over 1,500 ransomware attacks
- Recovery of decryption keys that may help thousands of victims

## The Syndicate

The group, known as "DarkVault," targeted hospitals, municipalities, and critical infrastructure since 2023. Victims include:

- Three major hospital systems forced to cancel surgeries
- A metropolitan transit authority shut down for two weeks
- Multiple school districts whose data was held for ransom

## Investigation Details

The investigation began 18 months ago when a ransomware victim contacted the FBI. Digital forensics eventually traced the group's operations to servers in Ukraine, where local authorities proved essential partners.

"This sends a clear message," said the FBI Director. "There is no safe harbor for cybercriminals."

## Ongoing Efforts

Authorities believe additional members of the network remain at large. The investigation continues.
