The Federal Reserve's latest policy statement has sent ripples through financial markets, with subtle language changes suggesting a potential pivot toward rate cuts in the coming months.

## Reading Between the Lines

In their December meeting minutes, Fed officials removed the phrase "further tightening may be appropriate," replacing it with "the Committee will assess incoming data." This linguistic shift, while seemingly minor, represents a significant change in the central bank's posture.

## Inflation Trends

Recent Consumer Price Index data shows year-over-year inflation at 2.4%, down from a peak of 7.1% in 2024. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has similarly declined to 2.8%.

## Market Reaction

Treasury yields fell sharply following the announcement:
- 10-year Treasury: Down 15 basis points to 3.85%
- 2-year Treasury: Down 22 basis points to 4.12%

Equity markets rallied on the news, with the S&P 500 gaining 1.8% in afternoon trading.

## What This Means

The Fed appears to be threading a delicate needle—acknowledging progress on inflation while maintaining optionality. Market participants now price in a 70% probability of a rate cut by March.
