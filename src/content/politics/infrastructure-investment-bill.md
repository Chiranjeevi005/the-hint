The federal government unveiled a sweeping $500 billion infrastructure package today, marking the largest single investment in the nation's physical infrastructure in decades.

## Key Provisions

The legislation includes funding for:

- **Highway Modernization**: $150 billion for road repairs and highway expansion
- **Bridge Safety**: $80 billion to address structurally deficient bridges
- **Public Transit**: $100 billion for subway, bus, and light rail systems
- **Broadband Access**: $65 billion to expand rural internet connectivity
- **Electric Vehicle Infrastructure**: $50 billion for charging station networks

## Economic Impact

Economists project the package will create approximately 2 million jobs over the next decade, with particular emphasis on skilled trades and construction sectors.

"This represents a generational investment in America's future," said the Transportation Secretary during the announcement. "These aren't just roads and bridges—they're the backbone of our economy."

## Legislative Path

The bill passed with bipartisan support, receiving 68 votes in the Senate. Implementation is expected to begin within 90 days of the President's signature.
