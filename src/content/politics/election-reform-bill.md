The United States Senate passed comprehensive election reform legislation early this morning, concluding a 22-hour debate that tested partisan fault lines while ultimately securing bipartisan support.

## Key Provisions

The legislation includes several major reforms:

- **Automatic Voter Registration**: Citizens will be automatically registered when interacting with government agencies
- **Early Voting Standards**: Mandates minimum 14-day early voting period across all states
- **Mail-In Ballot Accessibility**: Standardizes mail-in voting procedures nationwide
- **Election Security Funding**: Allocates $2 billion for cybersecurity upgrades

## Political Implications

The bill's passage represents a significant victory for centrist lawmakers who spent months negotiating compromises acceptable to both parties.
