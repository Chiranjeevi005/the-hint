The Climate Resilience Act advanced through the Senate Environment Committee today with bipartisan support, signaling potential breakthrough on climate adaptation policy.

## Legislative Focus

The bill addresses:

- **Coastal Protection**: Sea wall and wetland restoration funding
- **Grid Hardening**: Electrical infrastructure resilience investments
- **Water Security**: Drought mitigation and water storage projects
- **Emergency Preparedness**: Enhanced disaster response capabilities

## Political Dynamics

The bill's focus on adaptation rather than emissions reduction has attracted support from lawmakers previously skeptical of climate legislation.
