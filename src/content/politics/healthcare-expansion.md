The House Ways and Means Committee approved a major healthcare expansion bill today, advancing legislation that would dramatically reshape the nation's insurance marketplace.

## Coverage Expansion

The bill proposes extending healthcare access through:

- **Public Option**: New government-run insurance plan available on exchanges
- **Subsidy Increases**: Enhanced premium support for middle-income families
- **Medicaid Expansion**: Incentives for remaining holdout states

## Cost Estimates

The Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation would cost $400 billion over ten years while reducing the uninsured rate to historic lows.
