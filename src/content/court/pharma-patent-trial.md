A high-stakes patent trial began today in a dispute between two pharmaceutical giants over the formulation of a blockbuster diabetes medication.

## Case Overview

The litigation involves:

- **Infringement Claims**: Allegations of unauthorized use of patented drug delivery technology
- **Validity Challenges**: Defendant argues patents should never have been granted
- **Market Impact**: Drug generates $4 billion in annual sales
- **Generic Competition**: Outcome will affect when cheaper versions become available

## Trial Expectations

The trial is expected to last four weeks, with a jury deciding both infringement and damages questions.
