A federal appeals court struck down a major EPA climate regulation today, ruling the agency exceeded its statutory authority in setting comprehensive emissions standards for the power sector.

## Court Reasoning

The three-judge panel found:

- **Statutory Limits**: Congress did not grant authority for sector-wide transformation
- **Major Questions Doctrine**: Significant economic decisions require clear congressional authorization
- **Regulatory Scope**: Individual plant-based standards may be permissible
- **Remedy**: Regulation vacated pending congressional action

## Policy Implications

The Administration indicated it would seek Supreme Court review while considering alternative regulatory approaches.
