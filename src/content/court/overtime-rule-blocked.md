A federal judge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction today blocking implementation of new overtime rules that would have extended protections to millions of additional workers.

## Court Reasoning

The judge found:

- **Statutory Authority**: Department interpretation conflicts with congressional intent
- **Economic Impact**: Rule imposes significant compliance costs on employers
- **Salary Threshold**: Automatic increases exceed regulatory authority
- **Irreparable Harm**: Employers would face unrecoverable compliance costs

## Administrative Response

The Labor Department announced plans to appeal while preparing alternative regulatory approaches.
