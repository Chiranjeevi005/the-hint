The Supreme Court announced today it will hear arguments in *United States v. Morrison*, a case that could redefine privacy protections in the digital age.

## The Case

David Morrison was convicted of conspiracy charges based on evidence obtained through warrantless collection of his cell phone location data over a six-month period. Lower courts have split on whether such collection constitutes a "search" under the Fourth Amendment.

## Key Questions

The Court will address several critical issues:

1. Does continuous collection of location data require a warrant?
2. What level of specificity must a warrant contain when seeking digital information?
3. Do third-party doctrine exceptions apply to metadata?

## Implications

Privacy advocates argue a ruling in favor of the government could effectively eliminate Fourth Amendment protections for the digital footprints Americans generate daily.

"Everything we do creates data," said the lead attorney for Morrison. "If the government can access all that information without judicial oversight, we have no privacy left."

## What's Next

Oral arguments are scheduled for March. A decision is expected by the end of the Court's term in June.
