The Supreme Court heard oral arguments today in a closely watched case that could reshape digital privacy protections for millions of Americans.

## Legal Issues

The case presents critical questions:

- **Third-Party Doctrine**: Whether sharing data with companies waives privacy expectations
- **Location Tracking**: Standards for government access to cell tower records
- **Technology Scope**: Application to emerging technologies beyond phones
- **Warrant Requirements**: Specificity needed for digital data requests

## Potential Impact

A ruling is expected by June and could affect law enforcement access to various forms of digital information.
