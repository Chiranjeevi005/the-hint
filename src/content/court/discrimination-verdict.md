A federal appeals court upheld an $85 million discrimination verdict today, affirming findings that a major corporation engaged in systemic racial discrimination in its promotion practices.

## Appellate Findings

The court affirmed:

- **Pattern Evidence**: Statistical and testimonial evidence supported class claims
- **Remedial Failure**: Company ignored internal reports documenting disparities
- **Damages Calculation**: Jury award reasonable given scope of discrimination
- **Injunctive Relief**: Ongoing monitoring of promotion practices required

## Corporate Response

The company announced it would not seek further review and committed to implementing court-ordered reforms.
