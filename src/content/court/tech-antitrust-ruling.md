A federal judge issued a landmark antitrust ruling today, ordering a major technology company to divest its browser business after finding it maintained an illegal monopoly in search and digital advertising.

## Key Findings

The court determined:

- **Market Power**: Company controls over 90% of search market
- **Exclusionary Conduct**: Default agreements with device makers foreclosed competition
- **Consumer Harm**: Reduced innovation and choice in search alternatives
- **Advertising Impact**: Monopoly extended to digital advertising markets

## Remedy Phase

The court will hold additional hearings to determine the specifics of the divestiture order and ongoing conduct requirements.
