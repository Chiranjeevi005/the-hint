The securities fraud trial of a prominent former hedge fund manager began today, with prosecutors outlining allegations of a years-long scheme that misled investors about the fund's performance and risk exposure.

## Prosecution Theory

The government alleges:

- **Performance Misrepresentation**: Fabricated returns and valuations
- **Risk Concealment**: Hidden exposure to volatile investments
- **Fee Fraud**: Excessive fees based on false performance claims
- **Document Destruction**: Attempted evidence tampering after investigation began

## Defense Position

Defense attorneys argued the defendant acted in good faith and that investment losses resulted from market conditions, not fraud.
