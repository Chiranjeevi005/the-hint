The State Supreme Court issued a closely divided ruling today that orders the redrawing of legislative districts, finding the current map constitutes an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

## Court Findings

The 4-3 decision found:

- **Partisan Intent**: Clear evidence of discriminatory purpose in map design
- **Vote Dilution**: Systematic weakening of opposing party's electoral strength
- **District Contiguity**: Oddly shaped districts designed to advantage one party
- **Remedial Authority**: Court has power to adopt independent commission maps

## Electoral Impact

The new maps must be implemented for this year's elections, potentially reshaping the balance of power in the legislature.
