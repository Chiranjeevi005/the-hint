After marathon negotiations in Brussels, European Union member states have agreed to the most ambitious climate targets in the bloc's history.

## The Commitment

The agreement commits all 27 member states to:

- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 65% from 1990 levels by 2035
- Achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, five years ahead of previous targets
- Phase out coal power by 2030
- Invest €500 billion in renewable energy infrastructure

## Overcoming Divisions

The deal required bridging significant gaps between wealthy Western European nations pushing for aggressive action and Eastern members concerned about economic impacts.

Poland, heavily dependent on coal, secured transition funding of €40 billion to assist with its energy sector transformation. Hungary extracted concessions on nuclear energy, which will count toward clean energy targets.

## Global Implications

Climate experts say the EU agreement raises the bar for upcoming international negotiations.

"Europe has shown it's possible to unite around ambitious climate action," said the UN climate chief. "This puts pressure on other major economies to match this commitment."

## Implementation Challenges

Critics note that meeting these targets will require unprecedented policy coordination and public investment. Transportation, agriculture, and heavy industry face particular challenges.

The Commission will present detailed implementation plans within 90 days.
