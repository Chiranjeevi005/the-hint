The United States incarcerates more people per capita than any other developed nation. This isn't a matter of political opinion—it's a statistical fact that demands attention from lawmakers across the political spectrum.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

Consider these figures:
- 1.9 million Americans are currently incarcerated
- The U.S. represents 4% of the world's population but houses 20% of its prisoners
- Recidivism rates hover near 44% within the first year after release

These statistics should trouble anyone who values both fiscal responsibility and human dignity.

## Common Ground Exists

Criminal justice reform has historically attracted support from unexpected allies. Conservative concerns about government overreach and wasteful spending align with progressive priorities around social justice and rehabilitation.

Several states have already demonstrated success with reform-oriented approaches:

- **Texas** reduced its prison population by 25% while crime rates continued to decline
- **Georgia** invested savings from reduced incarceration into drug courts and mental health services
- **Utah** implemented risk assessment tools that reduced pretrial detention without compromising public safety

## A Path Forward

Evidence-based sentencing reform isn't soft on crime—it's smart on crime. By focusing resources on violent offenders while offering alternatives for non-violent offenses, we can build a system that serves both justice and taxpayers.

The question isn't whether we can afford to reform our criminal justice system. It's whether we can afford not to.
