In the past decade, over 2,000 newspapers have closed across America. This is not merely an industry in decline—it is a democratic emergency.

## The Accountability Gap

When local newspapers disappear, corruption increases. Studies consistently show that municipal borrowing costs rise and fewer citizens run for local office when communities lose their newspapers.

## A Public Good

Journalism is not simply a business. It is essential infrastructure for democratic governance. We must consider public funding models that preserve editorial independence while ensuring sustainable coverage.

The marketplace has spoken. It is time for democracy to respond.
