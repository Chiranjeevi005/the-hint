Deficit hawks have dominated fiscal policy debates for decades, warning of imminent crisis from an ever-growing national debt. Yet the crisis has not arrived, and the austerity they demanded has caused real harm.

## The Real Fiscal Challenge

The true fiscal challenge is not debt levels but debt composition. Borrowing to finance consumption is problematic; borrowing to finance productive investment generates returns that service the debt.

## Reframing Priorities

We should focus less on debt-to-GDP ratios and more on returns-to-investment ratios. Infrastructure, education, and research generate economic gains that far exceed their costs.

Fiscal responsibility means investing wisely, not refusing to invest at all.
