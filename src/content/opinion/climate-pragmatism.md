The climate debate has become paralyzed by the pursuit of perfect policies. While advocates argue over the optimal carbon price and the ideal renewable energy mix, emissions continue to rise.

## The Cost of Delay

Every year of delay in meaningful climate action adds approximately $500 billion to the eventual cost of adaptation. We cannot afford the luxury of perfection.

## Pragmatic Progress

Imperfect carbon pricing is better than no carbon pricing. Modest renewable standards are better than none. Incremental progress builds political coalition for future action.

History will not judge us on the elegance of our policies, but on whether we acted when action was still possible.
