The American economy faces a demographic crisis. Birth rates have declined precipitously. Labor force growth has stalled. Entire industries struggle to fill essential positions.

## Economic Necessity

Immigration is not charity—it is economic necessity. Immigrants start businesses at higher rates than native-born Americans. They fill critical gaps in healthcare, agriculture, and technology.

## Policy Modernization

Our immigration system prioritizes family reunification and diversity over economic contribution. While these goals have value, we must also recognize the urgent need for workers across skill levels.

Ideology should not blind us to economic reality.
