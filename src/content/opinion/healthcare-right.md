Every developed nation except the United States provides universal healthcare coverage to its citizens. This is not a matter of ideology but of basic human dignity.

## The Moral Imperative

No person should die because they cannot afford insulin. No family should face bankruptcy because of a cancer diagnosis. No child should go without treatment because their parents lack insurance.

## Beyond Politics

Healthcare policy has become hopelessly entangled with partisan identity. But the underlying question is not political—it is moral. Do we believe every person has inherent dignity deserving of care?

The answer should be obvious. The policy implications should follow.
