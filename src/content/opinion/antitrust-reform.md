Traditional antitrust analysis focuses on consumer prices. But in the digital economy, many dominant platforms are free to consumers while extracting enormous value through data and network effects.

## New Forms of Harm

Market power in digital markets manifests differently: reduced privacy, diminished innovation, foreclosure of nascent competition. These harms are real but invisible to price-focused analysis.

The law must evolve or become irrelevant.
