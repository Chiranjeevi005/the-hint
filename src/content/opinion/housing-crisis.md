Housing costs have risen twice as fast as wages for three consecutive decades. Young families are locked out of homeownership. Renters face impossible trade-offs between housing and other necessities.

## Market Failures

The housing market is not a free market. Zoning restrictions, NIMBYism, and regulatory barriers have constrained supply in exactly the places where demand is highest.

## A National Strategy

We need a comprehensive national housing strategy that addresses both supply constraints and demand-side affordability. This must include federal intervention in local zoning, massive investment in public housing, and reform of mortgage finance.

Half-measures will not suffice. The magnitude of the crisis demands boldness.
